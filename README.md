**Libraries Used:** 
Pandas, Numpy, Matplot 

**Description:** 
The purpose of this project is to analyse whether certain atributes of the applicants to a loan influence the amount of loan they received. For this analysis we used a dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/raaad3000/credit-history

I analysed the impact of gender, married status, dependents, education, income, property area, etc.

**What I have learned so far from this project:**

- How to manage missing data from dataset
- Select the relevant information for analysis
- Plot information for better visualization 
- Group information in relevant attributes for deeper analysis
